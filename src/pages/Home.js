        iâ€™m debasish behera, your friendly neighborhood blockchain guy.
i do fintech things, blockchain stuff, and occasionally pretend to know what i'm doing.
right now, iâ€™m focused on celeriz â€“ think global payments, but less paperwork and no headache.

based between berlin and delhi, because why choose just one timezone to be confused in?
        </p>

        <p>when iâ€™m not working on cool tech, you can find me geeking out on all things crypto, teaching my laptop new tricks (aka coding), or explaining to my friends why blockchain isn't just for buying pizzas with bitcoin.

currently, iâ€™m busy creating solutions that make global payments simple. in other words, less crying over fees, more sending money like it's a text message.</p>
