      <h2>blog post incoming... just a few api calls away 🧑‍💻</h2>
<p>
  please be patient, our servers are busy making sure all the <code>console.logs</code> are cleared and the api requests are traveling at the speed of light (or so we hope).<br />
  currently waiting for the json to return from the abyss of the backend, probably lost somewhere between a 200 and a 500 status code.
</p>
<p>
  eta: once the code finally compiles without throwing a tantrum. meanwhile, feel free to enjoy some stack overflow tabs while we chase down that pesky null pointer exception.
</p>
<p>coming soon... or whenever the servers decide to cooperate 🤷‍♂️</p>
